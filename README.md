# Off-Platform Project: Excursion

In this project, I created a web page which advertises a product called “Excursion.” I used my growing toolset including HTML, CSS, Command Line Interface, Git, and GitHub. 

This was the off-platform project for the deploying github sites section of the course. 

What I learned/practiced

**Learned**
- VS Codes interface for working with files
- VS Codes boilerplate function for html using just the !
- VS Codes terminal integration
  - allowing git commands in the same space as working on files

**Practiced**
- git commands
- pushing to remote
- html/css
